# Final project:

Our final project consists of presenting an artefact that takes an existing technology and adds (a) new feature(s) to it. The main goal of this project is to start a discussion about the relationship between technology and values.
We hace chosen to create this website to showcase an improved smartwatch that takes into account diabetic people as it offers a feature that allows them to monitor their blood sugar levels.
