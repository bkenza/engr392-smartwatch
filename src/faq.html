                <h4>How does your SmartWatch take blood samples?</h4>
                <p> Our technology does not use a needle to get blood samples to return a reading on glucose levels. Instead sensors
                        embeded inside the bottom of the watch-face detect glucose levels through the skin in your hand.</p>
                <h4>How does your technology work?</h4>
                <p>There exists minute amounts of blood in the capilaries of your skin. Our technology uses these minute amounts of blood to get readings on glucose levels through out the day.</p>
                <h4>How much does it cost?</h4>
                <p>Head over to our <a href="pricing.html">pricing</a> page to learn about our plans.</p>
                <h4>Is it safe for children to use?</h4>
                <p>Absolutely!</p>
                <h4>Do I have to manually trigger the measurement of my glucose?</h4>
                <p>No! Our SmartWatch monitors glucose levels over 100 times a day, providing reliable and constant
                        glucose monitoring.</p>
                <h4>How does our SmartWatch differ from the other ones available in the market?</h4>
                <p>Other SmartWatches claim to care about health by monitoring heart rate and exercise. Our SmartWatch is speciliazed for specific areas of health. We care about the health of individuals who suffer from diabetes. From the ground up our technology is built to value specific health needs.</p>
                <h4>Is this device available to everyone?</h4>

                        them monitor their blood-glucose levels without requiring any supplementary accessories.</p>
                <h4>Is this device safe?</h4>
                <p>Absolutely! Our device is non-invasive and provides a safe means of monitoring blood-glucose levels.
                </p>
                <h4>Is it heavy?</h4>
                <p>On the contrary! Our device weighs a mere 30g. For more information about the technical
